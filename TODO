* Language
**  the dialog moves around when a different language is selected
**  replace the check box with a button?
**  language list - only show the varient (eg - United Kingdom) if there is more than one language that needs
**  do we need the "use" prefix?
* EULAs
* Network
**  need to check the connecting progress
* Account
**  just use the local account page by default, with a button for "use enterprise login instead" (design is required here)
**  act as administrator checkbox won't be useful
**  various alignment issues - text entry boxes need be longer
**  password entry - inline error icon isn't good here; we need a better approach to password hints
**  aday - i wouldn't include avatar selection
* Location
**  location data isn't good
**  map is too small
* GOA
**  "Link other accounts"? is that right?
**  need to use egglistbox
**  remove button is too prominent - this part of the assistant is primarily about adding accounts
**  "Add Account" should be "Add Account..."?
**  empty state is bad (needs design)
**  needs an explanatory string - what are online accounts? what do they do?
* Summary
**  if we have a slick welcome video, and it is the first install, we can drop the tour button and just show the video
**  or use a checkbox to disable the video?
* General
**  window needs to be bigger
**  on small screens the window should be maximised
**  egglistbox!
* Other
**  keyboard layout / input methods?
**  opt out of diagnostics?
