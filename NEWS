 * Add a language selector to replace the Welcome splash screen
   before.
 * GDM integration has been rewritten to use libgdm instead of
   libgdmuser.
 * A lot of code has been properly split out into static
   libraries; each page now has one static library. In the
   future, we will have an unsupported module API that can be
   used to extend the system.
 * Use a cc-notebook, stolen from gnome-control-center, that
   allows smooth animations between pages. A plain GTK+
   implementation is being written for systems without the
   capabilities to run animations.
 * Complete integration by including a copy worker run on session
   init. This strategy should work for the use case of enterprise
   users.
 * Fix libcheese integration, and disallow the file picker when
   choosing a user icon.
